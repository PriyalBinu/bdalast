## Introduction
This project aims to analyze the relationship between thyroid diseases and cardiovascular diseases. The analysis involves exploring the thyroid dataset for autoimmune diseases and comparing it with cardiovascular data to draw meaningful conclusions regarding their correlation.

## Datasets
1. **Thyroid Dataset**: Contains data on various thyroid conditions.
2. **Cardiovascular Dataset**: `cardio_train.csv` which includes the following columns:
   - `id`: Unique identifier for each record
   - `age`: Age of the individual
   - `gender`: Gender of the individual
   - `height`: Height in cm
   - `weight`: Weight in kg
   - `ap_hi`: Systolic blood pressure
   - `ap_lo`: Diastolic blood pressure
   - `cholesterol`: Cholesterol levels
   - `gluc`: Glucose levels
   - `smoke`: Smoking status
   - `alco`: Alcohol consumption status
   - `active`: Activity level
   - `cardio`: Target variable indicating cardiovascular disease

## Analysis of Autoimmune Diseases
The analysis begins with the examination of the thyroid dataset to identify autoimmune diseases. This includes cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and identifying specific columns related to autoimmune conditions.

### Code Snippet
```python
# Load the thyroid dataset
thyroid_data = pd.read_csv('thyroid_data.csv')  # Update with actual path

# Analyze autoimmune diseases
autoimmune_diseases = thyroid_data[thyroid_data['condition'] == 'Autoimmune']
print(autoimmune_diseases.describe())
Requirements
